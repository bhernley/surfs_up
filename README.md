# Surfs_Up Challenge Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of our analysis is to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. We'll compare temperature statistics for June and December in order to do so. We'll pull information from the weather stations and analyze the the information from mid-summer and mid winter months.  Using Summer(June) as an optimal time to surf, we'll then compare Winter(December) to see how much the temperature varies.

## Results:
- In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0
- In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0
- A Standard deviation is of under 4 degrees in both months suggests that relatively consistant weather throughout the year
- The data indicates the weather year round should be similiar enough that a surf shop should be viable year round.
